## Challenge Overview 
Tasked with reporting total number of votes cast, total number of votes for each candidate, percentage of votes of each candidate and winner of the election.  The results will be coming from mail-in ballots, punch cards, and direct recording electronic counting machines.  THe challenge is to create a vote count report to certify this US congressional election, so the code could be used fo other elections.

## Challenge Summary
The challenge proved successful and the election results were automated to:

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who recieved votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
